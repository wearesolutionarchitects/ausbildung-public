# Consider the Interaction Principles of ISO Standard 9241-110 When Planning User Interfaces

Form a team of four to six people and develop ideas on how the interaction principles can be considered and implemented in the design of the website.

Divide the work within the team.

Afterwards, discuss your ideas with the entire class.

**Notes:**

- Alternatively, the task can also be applied to other user interfaces to be developed.
- Smaller teams can also be formed. The team focuses on selecting some interaction principles that are important to them, justifies the selection, and develops ideas only for these.
